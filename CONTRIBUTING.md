## Overview

**First of all, thank you for considering contributing to the project!**

We use [Nix](https://nixos.org) for this project as it ensures that we are all using the same tools. Please make sure you have nix version 2.16.0 or higher and have the nix-command and flakes experimental options enabled.

### Devcontainers

if you don't have nix installed and can't install it for whatever reason then there is a devcontainer you can use. When you enter a devcontainer it might take a while to pull the required image and set it all up. This will be faster after the first initial setup. Look at the documentation for your IDE on how to work with devcontainers.

## Commit Message Conventions

All commit messages must follow the [conventional commit specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification). This is to autogenerate the changelog and keep commits constant. There are pre-commit checks to help you not push wrongly formed commits by mistake.

## Branch Naming Conventions

Much like conventional commits we use conventional branch naming. This means that depending on what you're working on you should name your branch differently. For example:

- Name it `docs/*`, or `documentation/*` when working on documentation.
- Name it `feat/*`, or `feature/*` when working on a feature.
- Name it `bug/*`, `fix/*`, `bugfix`, or `fixes/*` when working on a bug fix.
- Name it `deps/*`, or `dependencies/*` when updating dependencies.

Where `*` describes your branch. So for example: `dependencies/update-xyz-from-v1.2.3-to-v4.5.6`. Make sure to use [kebab-case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Kebab_case).

These branch names will make it clear what your working on, and allows the [CI/CD](#continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-cicd) to label your PR better.

> [!NOTE]
> For a most up to date list of what branch names are used, go to [`.github/labeler.yml`](.github/labeler.yml), in there you can see a list of what "head-branches" are allowed and what they will be labeled.

## Testing

Most of the tests done are performed automatically. The tests we use are [pre-commit hooks](#pre-commit-hooks) for the most immediate feedback and [CI/CD](#continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-cicd) ensures everything is good before we merge!

To test run:

```SH
nix flake check
```

This will test the entire repository, including building, testing, formatting etc. There might be a warning that the path is dirty, this means there are uncommitted changes, nothing to worry about.

### Pre-commit hooks

As mentioned before we use pre-commit hooks. These run on commit or on push, they allow you to make sure that you're not adding typos, broken symlinks, binaries, and a bunch of other things. These pre-commit hooks have to be 'installed' This happens when you enter a development shell using `nix develop`. This install needs to be done the first time you enter the repo, and every time `.config/pre-commit.nix` is changed.

So make sure to run:

```sh
nix develop 
```

You can make this easier by allowing [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to run.

### Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

When interacting with this repository CI/CD will run to give you feedback, or help us out with some things. Only when all tests pass will we consider merging.

## Formatting

To format the files, run:

```SH
nix fmt
```

This will format all files or which there is a formatter installed. There might be warnings that no formatter is installed for some files. This is fine, you can safely ignore those warnings.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same licence as the rest of the repository.
